    DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP and HTTPS :
    

HTTPS is essentially HTTP enhanced with encryption and authentication. The key distinction is that HTTPS employs TLS (SSL) to encrypt and digitally sign standard HTTP requests and responses, significantly boosting security.

HTTP: Unsecured, indicated by http:// in the URL.
HTTPS: Secured with TLS encryption, indicated by https:// in the URL.



    HTTP STRUCTURE :

HTTP requests are generated by a user's browser during interactions with websites. For example:

When a user clicks on a hyperlink, the browser sends a series of HTTP GET requests to retrieve the content of the linked page.
If someone searches "What is HTTP?" on Google and clicks on this article in the search results, their browser creates and sends HTTP requests to get the information needed to display the page.
These HTTP requests are sent to an origin server or a proxy caching server, which then generates HTTP responses.

HTTP Responses:

These are the replies sent back to the browser in response to the HTTP requests, containing the requested content or information.
